- Behind the mess: Showing real systems, imperfect progress
- Observations: What you're seeing in creator DM funnels
- Quick wins: Tactical tips for better DM conversion

### Secondary Channel: Instagram

**Why Instagram:**
- Your ICP lives there (you're helping Instagram creators)
- Demonstrates you understand the platform
- Can use your own DMs as proof of concept
- Eventually: show your AI in action on your own account

**Content Focus:**
- Repurpose TikTok content
- Behind-the-scenes stories
- DM conversion tips
