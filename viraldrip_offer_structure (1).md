## How It Works (Client-Facing Explanation)

### Step 1: We Learn Your Voice
We audit your content, study how you communicate, and document everything about your offer. This becomes your AI's knowledge base.

### Step 2: We Build Your AI Agent
We create an AI agent trained specifically on YOUR content. It knows your offer, speaks in your voice, and handles conversations like you would.

### Step 3: We Connect Everything
We integrate the AI agent with ManyChat, set up triggers for comments and DMs, and connect your lead tracking system.

### Step 4: Your AI Goes Live
Your AI agent starts handling conversations 24/7. It qualifies leads, scores them, and routes them — hot leads to you, everyone else handled automatically.

### Step 5: We Optimize Continuously
We monitor performance, improve responses, and keep your knowledge base updated. Your AI gets smarter over time.
