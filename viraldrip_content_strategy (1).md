# ViralDrip.ai — Content Strategy (Build-in-Public)

## Document Purpose
This document defines the content strategy for ViralDrip.ai and Jonas's personal brand on TikTok/Instagram. The approach is build-in-public: documenting the journey of building an AI automation business from scratch, sharing wins, losses, and lessons. Designed for the current stage — pre-expert, pre-testimonials, learning as we go.

---

## Company Context

**Brand:** ViralDrip.ai (business) + Jonas (personal brand)  
**Stage:** Early — building from scratch, proving the concept  
**Platform:** TikTok (primary), Instagram (secondary)  
**Frequency:** 3 posts per week / 12 posts per month  
**Format:** Talking head + occasional screen recordings  
**Production:** Jonas films raw footage, editor handles post-production

---

## Content Philosophy

### The Build-in-Public Approach

**The Reality:**
- New offer, proving it works
- Building systems in real time
- No testimonials or case studies yet
- Learning and iterating as we go

**Why This Is An Advantage:**

| Traditional Approach | Build-in-Public Approach |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Wait until you're an expert | Share the learning process |
| Only show polished wins | Show the mess, the real |
| Teach from authority | Learn out loud |
| Need proof before posting | The journey IS the proof |

**The Benefits:**

1. **Origin stories are compelling.** Following someone from zero is engaging.
2. **Authenticity stands out.** "I'm figuring this out" builds trust.
3. **Audience grows WITH you.** They're invested in your journey.
4. **Everything becomes content.** Struggles and wins are both valuable.
5. **Documented proof.** When you get results, you have receipts.

### Core Content Principle

**Show the journey, not the destination.**

You're not positioning as the guru with all answers. You're the builder figuring it out, sharing what you learn, bringing people along for the ride.

---

## Content Pillars

These are the 4 themes all content fits into:

| Pillar | What It Is | Vibe |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **The Journey** | What you're building, why, progress | "Here's what happened this week" |
| **Lessons Learned** | Things you figured out, mistakes | "I learned this the hard way" |
| **Behind the Mess** | Raw, unpolished look at the work | "It's ugly but it works" |
| **Observations** | Patterns you're noticing, questions | "I've been seeing this" |

### Pillar Details

**1. The Journey**
Document the building process. Updates, milestones, progress, setbacks.

Examples:
- "Day 1 of building AI systems for creators"
- "Week 3. First audit call booked."
- "Month 1 recap. Here's what happened."

**2. Lessons Learned**
Share what you figured out — especially the hard way. Mistakes are content.

Examples:
- "I spent 4 hours building this the wrong way"
- "This one change doubled response rates"
- "What I wish I knew about AI agents before starting"

**3. Behind the Mess**
Show the real, unpolished work. Imperfect systems, works in progress.

Examples:
- "Here's my Make.com scenario. It's held together with duct tape."
- "This is what my AI training process looks like. Messy but real."
- "My first ManyChat flow — ugly but it works."

**4. Observations**
Share what you're noticing in the creator DM space. Curiosity is enough.

Examples:
- "I've been auditing creator DMs. Here's what I'm seeing."
- "Why do creators treat all leads the same?"
- "The pattern I keep seeing with burned-out creators."

---

## Topic Categories

Beyond pillars, here are specific topic areas to rotate through:

### 1. DM Problems (Problem Awareness)
Content that highlights the problems creators face with DMs.

- "Why creators are drowning in DMs"
- "The hidden cost of slow response times"
- "What happens when you treat every lead the same"
- "Why generic ManyChat flows kill conversions"
- "The tire-kicker problem nobody talks about"

### 2. AI/Automation Education (Solution Awareness)
Content that educates about AI and automation possibilities.

- "What an AI agent actually is (not a chatbot)"
- "How AI can sound like you (voice training explained)"
- "The difference between flows and intelligence"
- "What RAG means and why it matters for DMs"
- "Why speed-to-lead is everything"

### 3. Quick Wins (Tactical Value)
Actionable tips they can implement themselves.

- "One change to your ManyChat that helps immediately"
- "The first question you should ask every DM"
- "How to spot a tire-kicker in 2 messages"
- "The welcome message framework that works"
- "Simple way to prioritize hot leads"

### 4. Behind the Build (Show Your Work)
Show what you're actually building and how.

- "Building an AI agent from scratch — here's how"
- "Training an AI on creator content (screen recording)"
- "Setting up lead scoring in ManyChat"
- "What my knowledge base looks like"
- "Testing AI responses — what I'm looking for"

### 5. Hot Takes (Personality + Engagement)
Opinions that spark reaction and show perspective.

- "Most DM automation is broken. Here's why."
- "You don't need more followers. You need better conversion."
- "The creator economy's biggest lie about scaling"
- "Why I don't trust 'gurus' who don't use their own systems"
- "Manual DMs are not 'personal.' They're unsustainable."

## CTA Strategy

You're not selling hard yet. You're inviting people into the journey.

| CTA Level | Frequency | What You Say |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|
| **No CTA** | 8-9 posts/month | Just share. Let people follow naturally. |
| **Soft Invite** | 2-3 posts/month | "If you want me to audit your DMs, link in bio." |
| **Journey CTA** | 1 post/month | "Following along? I share more on my website." |

### CTA Framing

**Don't say:**
- "Book a call to learn how to..."
- "DM me for a free guide"
- "Sign up for my program"

**Do say:**
- "Link in bio if you want me to look at your DMs"
- "I do free audits — link in bio"
- "Documenting the whole journey at viraldrip.ai"

The vibe is invitation, not promotion.

## Evolution Over Time

Your content naturally evolves as you grow:

| Stage | What You Have | Content Focus |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| **Now** | Nothing yet | Journey, lessons, observations, mess |
| **First clients** | 1-3 clients | Add: What I learned from real projects |
| **Working systems** | Proven AI agents | Add: Here's how I built this |
| **Results** | Testimonials, data | Add: Case studies, before/after |
| **Authority** | Track record | Add: Hot takes, tactical advice |

Don't force the evolution. It happens naturally. For now, the journey IS the content.

## Production Workflow

### Your Job (Raw Footage)

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Batch scripting | 1-2 hours/month | Write hooks + key points |
| Batch filming | 2-3 hours/month | Record all talking head |
| Screen recordings | 1 hour/month | Record when showing systems |

**Total time per month: ~4-6 hours**

### Editor's Job

- Cuts and pacing
- Captions (critical for TikTok)
- Text overlays

### Weekly Workflow

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Session day | Film 3-4 videos raw |

---

## Platform Notes

### TikTok

- First 1-2 seconds are everything (hook)
- Captions mandatory (most watch muted)
- Vertical video only (9:16)
- 30-90 seconds sweet spot
- Post consistently (same days/times)
- Engage with comments in first hour
- 3-5 relevant hashtags

### Instagram (Reels)

- Repurpose TikTok content
- Slightly different hashtag strategy
- Use stories for behind-the-scenes
- Engage with DMs (practice what you preach)

### Bio Structure

```

| Only showing wins | Not relatable | Share struggles too |
| Hard selling every video | Annoying | Soft CTAs, mostly value |
