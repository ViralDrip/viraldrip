## The Audit Call Framework

### Call Structure (30 Minutes)

| Phase | Duration | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| 1. Warm-up | 2-3 min | Build rapport, set expectations |
| 2. Discovery | 8-10 min | Understand their situation |
| 3. Audit | 10-12 min | Show them their DM leaks |
| 4. Bridge | 5-7 min | Present solution if qualified |
| 5. Close/Exit | 2-3 min | Define next step |

---

## Phase 1: Warm-up (2-3 min)

### Goal
Set expectations, build rapport, establish control of the call.

### Script Framework

> "Hey [Name], good to meet you. Before we dive in — here's how this works: I'm going to ask you some questions about your Instagram, your DMs, and how you're currently handling leads. Then we'll look at your setup together and I'll show you exactly where I see leaks. You'll walk away with clarity either way. Sound good?"

### What This Achieves
- Shows you're structured and professional
- Promises value regardless of outcome
- Gets their buy-in to follow your lead
- Removes pressure, builds trust

---

## Phase 2: Discovery (8-10 min)

### Goal
Understand their business, current DM process, and pain points. Gather information needed for the audit AND to qualify them.

### Discovery Questions

**About Their Business:**
- "Tell me about your business — what do you sell and who's it for?"
- "What's your offer priced at?" (Helps understand deal value)
- "What's your monthly revenue from Instagram right now?"
- "What's the goal? Where are you trying to get to?"

**About Their Instagram/DMs:**
- "Walk me through what happens when someone DMs you interested in your offer."
- "How many DMs are you getting per day/week?"
- "How long does it typically take you to respond?"
- "Are you using any automation right now? ManyChat? Something else?"
- "What's your current process for figuring out who's actually ready to buy?"

**About Their Pain:**
- "How much time are you spending in DMs every day?"
- "What percentage of those conversations actually lead to a sale?"
- "What's the most frustrating part of handling DMs?"
- "Have you tried to automate this before? What happened?"

### Listen For (Qualification Signals)

**Green Flags:**
- Revenue $10k+/month (can afford the service)
- Getting regular DMs (system will have leads to work with)
- Spending 1+ hours daily in DMs (real pain)
- Already using "DM me" or comment triggers (understands the game)
- Tried ManyChat but found it too robotic
- Frustrated with tire-kickers wasting time
- Has a proven offer (people are buying)

**Red Flags:**
- Revenue under $5k/month (may not be ready to invest)
- Very few DMs (need more traffic first)
- No clear offer or pricing
- Expects magic bullet with no input
- Already has a complex system that's working
- Difficult communication style

### Take Notes
Document their answers. You'll reference these in the audit phase and in your follow-up proposal.

---

## Phase 3: The Audit (10-12 min)

### Goal
Show them their specific DM leaks, deliver real value, build credibility.

### Process

**Step 1:** Ask to see their current setup

> "Alright, let's take a look. Can you share your screen and show me what happens when someone DMs you? Walk me through your ManyChat or whatever you're using."

If they don't have automation:
> "No worries — let's look at some recent DM conversations. Show me a few that did and didn't convert."

**Step 2:** Have them show you:
1. Their ManyChat flows (if any)
2. How they respond to common inquiries
3. Recent DM conversations
4. Their link in bio / entry point
5. Any triggers they're using (comment keywords, etc.)

**Step 3:** Identify and call out leaks

### Universal DM Leak Points

| Leak | What It Looks Like | What to Say |
|------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Slow response** | Hours or days to reply | "This person DMed at 2pm, you replied at 9pm. In those 7 hours, they probably forgot or found someone else. Speed matters — a lot." |
| **Generic bot responses** | Template messages, no personalization | "This feels like a bot. Your followers can tell. It breaks the trust you built with your content." |
| **No qualification** | Same response to everyone | "This person said they're 'just curious' and this person said 'I need help now.' They got the same response. That's a leak." |
| **No follow-up** | Conversation dies, no re-engagement | "They went quiet after this message. What happened? Nothing. That's money sitting there." |
| **Manual everything** | They respond personally to each DM | "You're doing all of this manually. That's 2 hours a day you're losing. And when you're busy, leads fall through." |
| **Can't tell who's hot** | No scoring or prioritization | "How do you know who to focus on? Right now you're guessing. An AI agent would score every lead automatically." |
| **Doesn't sound like them** | Bot has generic corporate tone | "This doesn't sound like you. Compare this to how you talk in your Reels. Totally different vibe." |
| **No segmentation** | Everyone goes to same place | "Someone ready to buy and someone just browsing get the same funnel. That's leaving money on the table." |

### Deliver Value

- Point out 2-3 specific leaks you identified
- Explain WHY each leak is costing them money
- Give them one quick win they could implement themselves

> "Here's something you could do this week even if we never talk again: [quick win]. That alone will help."

Examples of quick wins:
- "Set up a simple welcome message that acknowledges them within seconds"
- "Add one qualifying question to your current flow"
- "Create a separate response for people who mention price vs. just 'info'"

This builds trust and proves you know your stuff.

---

## Phase 4: The Bridge (5-7 min)

### Goal
Transition from audit to your offer — only if they're qualified.

### Internal Qualification Check

Before pitching, confirm in your head:

| Criteria | Required |
|----------|----------|
| Revenue $10k+/month | Yes |
| Getting consistent DMs | Yes |
| Has leaks your system can fix | Yes |
| Has a proven offer | Yes |
| Seems coachable/reasonable | Yes |
| Ready to invest (time + money) | Ideally |

### If Qualified — Bridge to Offer

> "So here's what I'm seeing: You've got the content, you've got the audience, and you've got an offer that sells. But your DMs have [leak 1] and [leak 2]. That's the gap.
>
> What I do is build an AI agent that fixes this. Not a generic bot — an AI trained on YOUR content, YOUR voice, YOUR offer. It responds instantly, qualifies leads through real conversation, scores them by buying readiness, and routes hot leads directly to you.
>
> You'd only talk to people ready to buy. Everyone else is handled.
>
> Want me to walk you through how that would work for you specifically?"

### If They Say Yes — Explain the Offer

**What you'd build:**
- AI agent trained on their content and voice
- Knowledge base from their offer, FAQs, objection handling
- Lead scoring based on buying readiness
- Smart routing (hot → call, warm → nurture, cold → filter)
- ManyChat integration with comment/DM triggers
- CRM tracking and lead dashboard

**How it works:**
- "I'd audit all your content and learn how you communicate"
- "Build a knowledge base so the AI knows your stuff inside out"
- "Train it to sound like you — your phrases, your energy"
- "Set up qualification questions and scoring logic"
- "Connect it to ManyChat so it handles every DM automatically"
- "You'd only talk to people who are scored as ready to buy"

**Timeline:**
- 4 weeks from kickoff to live

**Their involvement:**
- ~4-5 hours total over 4 weeks
- Kickoff call, async Q&A, review, approval

**Investment:**
- Setup fee: [SETUP_PRICE_PLACEHOLDER]
- Monthly retainer: [RETAINER_PRICE_PLACEHOLDER]

> "The setup builds and launches everything. The retainer keeps it optimized — I monitor conversations, improve responses, and update the knowledge base as your offer evolves."

### If Not Qualified — Exit Gracefully

> "Honestly, based on what you've shared, I don't think this is the right fit for you right now. Your bigger priority is [getting more traffic / clarifying your offer / something else]. Once you've got that dialed, this would make a lot of sense.
>
> But here's what I'd focus on in the meantime: [give genuine advice]."

They'll remember you. When they're ready, they'll come back.

---

## Phase 5: Close or Next Step (2-3 min)

### If They're Interested

> "If you want to move forward, here's how it works: I'll send you a proposal today with everything we talked about — the leaks I found, what I'd build, timeline, and investment. You review it, and if it looks good, we kick off next week. Sound fair?"

**Don't pressure.** Confidence > pushiness.

### If They Need to Think

> "Totally get it. I'll send over a summary of what we found plus the full proposal. Take a few days, and if questions come up, just reply. No pressure either way."

### If It's a No

> "No worries at all. Appreciate you taking the time. If anything changes down the road, you know where to find me."

### End the Call

> "Thanks again, [Name]. You'll have my email within the hour. Talk soon."

---

## Post-Call Actions

### Immediate (Within 1 Hour)

Send summary email containing:

1. **Recap of leaks identified** (2-3 bullet points)
2. **What you'd build for them** (brief description)
3. **Timeline** (4 weeks)
4. **Investment** (setup + retainer)
5. **Next step** (reply to confirm or book follow-up)

**Email Template:**

Subject: Your DM Audit Recap + Next Steps

> Hey [Name],
>
> Great chatting today. Here's what we found:
>
> **The Leaks:**
> - [Leak 1 — e.g., "Response time averaging 4+ hours — losing hot leads to competitors"]
> - [Leak 2 — e.g., "Same response to everyone regardless of buying intent"]
> - [Leak 3 — e.g., "No system to identify who's ready to buy vs. tire-kickers"]
>
> **What I'd Build:**
> An AI agent trained on your content and voice that:
> - Responds instantly to every DM
> - Qualifies leads through natural conversation
> - Scores them by buying readiness
> - Routes hot leads to you, handles everyone else automatically
>
> You'd only talk to people ready to buy. Everything else runs 24/7 without you.
>
> **Timeline:** 4 weeks from kickoff to live
>
> **Investment:**
> - Setup: [SETUP_PRICE_PLACEHOLDER]
> - Monthly: [RETAINER_PRICE_PLACEHOLDER]
>
> If you're ready to move forward, just reply and I'll send the agreement.
>
> Either way — the leaks we found are real. Even [quick win you mentioned] would help.
>
> Talk soon,
> Jonas

### Day 3: First Follow-up

If no response:

> Hey [Name], just floating this back up. Any questions about the proposal? Happy to clarify anything.

### Day 7: Final Follow-up

If still no response:

> Hey [Name], checking in one last time on the AI agent. No pressure either way — just let me know if you want to move forward or if timing isn't right. I'll leave the proposal open.

### After Day 7

- No more follow-ups
- Add to nurture list
- Move on

---

## Objection Handling

### "It's too expensive"

> "I hear you. Here's how I think about it: if this AI helps you close even [X] extra sales per month, it's paid for itself — and it runs forever. But I get it if budget is tight. Happy to revisit when timing is better."

### "Can AI really sound like me?"

> "That's the whole point of what we do. We don't use templates. We train the AI on YOUR content — your posts, your voice, how you actually talk. I can show you examples of how it works. Followers won't be able to tell."

### "How is this different from ManyChat?"

> "ManyChat is the delivery system — it sends the messages. But a flow-based bot can only follow scripts. What we build is an AI agent with your knowledge base. It actually understands what you teach and sell. When someone asks an unexpected question, it handles it. That's the difference between robotic and real."

### "What if it says something wrong?"

> "First, we test extensively before going live. Second, we set up guardrails — topics it redirects to you, things it won't say. Third, I'm monitoring ongoing. If something goes off, we catch it fast. But honestly, a well-trained AI is more consistent than a tired human at 11pm."

### "I've tried automation before and it was too robotic"

> "Exactly — because most automation is flow-based. 'If they say X, respond Y.' That feels robotic because it is. We build something different — an AI trained on your content that can actually have a conversation. Different approach, different result."

### "My audience expects ME to respond"

> "Your superfans, yes — and they'll still get you for the important stuff. But most DMs are the same questions over and over. Right now, you're either burning out or ignoring people. The AI handles the 80% so you can focus on the 20% that matters."

### "I need to think about it"

> "Totally fair. I'll send everything over in writing. Take your time — and if questions come up, just reply."
