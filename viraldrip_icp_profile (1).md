## Current Situation

### What's Working

- Content is getting views and engagement
- They have a proven offer that sells
- Audience is growing
- DMs are coming in with interest
- They know how to create and show up consistently

### What's Broken

- Can't respond to every DM fast enough
- Spending hours in DMs with people who never buy
- No system to separate hot leads from tire-kickers
- Using basic ManyChat flows that feel robotic
- Missing hot leads because response time is too slow
- Same follow-up sequence for everyone regardless of intent
- Manual qualification is exhausting and doesn't scale

---

## Psychology

### Goals

- Convert more of their existing Instagram traffic into buyers
- Spend less time in DMs, more time creating content
- Only talk to people who are actually ready to buy
- Have a system that qualifies leads 24/7 without them
- Scale their business without hiring a sales team
- Make their Instagram DMs feel personal at scale

### Frustrations

- "I'm getting tons of DMs but most of them go nowhere"
- "I spend hours qualifying people who can't afford my offer"
- "My ManyChat flows feel robotic and people can tell"
- "I miss hot leads because I can't respond fast enough"
- "I don't know who's ready to buy vs who's just curious"
- "I can't be in my DMs 24/7 but that's what it takes"

### Fears

- AI will sound robotic and damage their personal brand
- Automation will feel impersonal to their audience
- Missing out on sales because bot says the wrong thing
- Tech being too complicated to set up or maintain
- Losing the personal touch that built their brand
- Paying for something that doesn't actually work

---

## Buying Behavior

### Purchase Triggers

- Just had a viral Reel and got flooded with DMs they couldn't handle
- Calculated how much revenue they're losing to slow response times
- Burned out from spending 3+ hours daily in DMs
- Saw a competitor closing more sales with less effort
- Launched a new offer and realized their current system can't scale
- Hired a VA for DMs but it's expensive and inconsistent

### Common Objections

- "Can AI really sound like me?"
- "How is this different from ManyChat?"
- "What if it says something wrong to a hot lead?"
- "My audience expects ME to respond"
- "I've tried automation before and it felt too robotic"
- "How do I know this will actually convert?"

### Where They Spend Attention

- Instagram (obviously — they live there)
- YouTube (learning from other creators)
- Podcasts about creator business and online coaching
- Facebook groups for course creators and coaches
- Twitter/X (some, especially business coaches)
- Other creators' email lists and communities

---

## Identification Signals

Use these signals to identify potential customers:

- Posts Reels consistently (3+ per week)
- Has a link in bio to course/coaching offer
- Uses "DM me" or "Comment [keyword]" CTAs in content
- Has basic ManyChat setup but flows feel generic
- Mentions being "busy" or "overwhelmed" with DMs
- Sells coaching or courses in the $500–5,000 range
- Visible engagement on posts (comments asking about offers)
- Has testimonials/results posted (proven offer)

---

## Technical Environment

### Tools They Likely Use

| Category | Common Tools |
|----------|--------------|
| DM Automation | ManyChat (basic), or nothing |
| Email | ConvertKit, Mailchimp, Flodesk |
| Course Platform | Kajabi, Teachable, Thinkific, Stan Store |
| Scheduling | Calendly, TidyCal, Acuity |
| Payment | Stripe, PayPal |
| CRM | None, or basic spreadsheet |

### Technical Comfort Level

- Not technical — don't want to learn complex systems
- Prefer done-for-you over DIY
- Want it to "just work" without ongoing management
- Value simplicity over features

---

## The Transformation They Want

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Drowning in DMs, can't keep up | AI handles conversations 24/7 |
| Hours spent on tire-kickers | Only talk to qualified, ready-to-buy leads |
| Generic bot responses | AI sounds exactly like them |
| Missing hot leads | Instant response, no lead left behind |
| Same funnel for everyone | Smart routing based on buying readiness |
| Exhausted from manual sales | Focus on content, let AI qualify |
| Guessing who's ready to buy | Clear lead scoring and segmentation |
